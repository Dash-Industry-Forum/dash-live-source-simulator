"""Make infinite live DASH stream from VoD content in live-profile format.

The content is synchronized with a wall-clock and only available according to the standard (can be overridden).

Make a VoD file look like infinite live DASH content. The timing is synchronized with wall clock.

The structure of the content is

CONTENT_ROOT:   [contentName]/[Manifest].mpd
                [contentName]/[Representation][init].mp4,
                [contentName]/[Representation][segNr].m4s,

VOD_CONF_DIR: [contentName].cfg

The corresponding links are then:
Manifest: http://[server]/[prefix]/[contentName]/[Manifest].mpd
Init: http://[server]/[prefix]/[contentName]/[Representation]/[init].mp4
Media: http://[server]/[prefix]/[contentName]/[Representation]/[liveSegNr].m4s

To control availabilityStartTime (AST) and availabilityEndTime (AET), one can add extra parts to the URL after prefix.

../[prefix]/start_ut/... will set the AST to the UNIX time ut (clipped to a multiple of duration)
../[prefix]/start_ut/dur_dt/... will set the AET as well (ut+dt)
../[prefix]/start_ut/dur_dt1/dur_dt2/ will set the AET and then update it 2*minimumUpdatePeriod before it is reached

One can also make the initialization segments available earlier than AST, by using init_ot (offset time in seconds).

More options are available in newer versions.
After [prefix], one can specify the following (mixed with the start_X and dur_X parameters:
tsbd_x - timeshiftBufferDepth = x seconds
mup_x - minimumUpdatePeriod = x seconds
init_x - initSegmentAvailabilityOffset makes the init segments available ahead of time by x seconds
all_1 - make all segments available (no timing checks)

For dynamic MPDs, one can also specify a modulo_x period in minutes.

This has the effect that the `availabilityStartTime` and the `mediaPresentationDuration`
vary in an `x`-minute periodic pattern.
The number `x` must be a divisor of 60, i.e. on of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60.
For example, if `x=10`, the following happens (mpd = mediaPresentationDuration, mup=minimumUpdatePeriod):

    hh:00:00-hh:00:59          ast = hh:00:00 mpd = 120s mup = 30s
    hh:01:00-hh:02:59          ast = hh:00:00 mpd = 240s
    hh:03:00-hh:04:59          ast = hh:00:00 mpd = 360s
    hh:05:00-hh:08:59          ast = hh:00:00 mpd = 480s
    hh:09:00-hh:10:59          ast = hh:10:00 mpd = 120s

In other words:

    mup = 5% of the interval
    0-10% of the interval, the mpd=20% of interval
    10-30% of the interval, the mpd=40% of the interval
    30-50% of the interval, the mpd=60% of the interval
    50-90% of the interval, the mpd=80% of the interval
    90-100% of the interval, the mpd=20% of the next interval

Thus, beyond the media session getting longer and longer during the first 50% of the session,
from 80-90% of the interval, the MPD will describe an expired session, and
from 90-100% of the interval, the MPD will describe a future session.

A new option is multiple periods. These are specified using periods_n in before the content.
If n == 0, only one period is created but is offset from the AST to have a test case for that together with the
correct value of presentationTimeOffset set in the SegmentTemplate.

A related option is peroff_1 that moves the presentationTimeOffset into a SegmentBase entity on the Period level.


Init and media segments can also be multiplexed on the fly. This happens if they have a path like
X__Y/segment, in which case the two segments corresponding to X/segment and Y/segment are fetched
and multiplexed.
